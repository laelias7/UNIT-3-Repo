#Breakout 3

#Wrangle the Data
```{r}
HorseHigh = mtcars[which(mtcars$hp > 200),]
HorseLow = mtcars[which(mtcars$hp < 200),]
```

#Check the assumptions
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(HorseHigh$mpg)
hist(HorseLow$mpg)
```

#Now assume that you are told that the data come from normal distributions.
```{r}
t.test(HorseHigh$mpg,HorseLow$mpg)
```

# Write the step 6 conclusion:
There is overwhelming evdence to suggest that the mean mpg of the low horse power group is greater than that of the high horsepower group (pvalue < .0001).  A 95% confidence interval for the difference is (5mpg, 11mpg).  Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.
